### Bugs

When implemented isSolved() function to the puzzle to show when puzzle has been solved in console.log it was going in infinte loop. 
The function call was misplaced and this was fixed by placing it into draw() function in js file, which have solved the issue.

When project was deployed bug below was coming up on accessing pages on the website, due to some file path declarations. This issue was resolved by fixing path to files and checked throughout the project making sure this does not happen.
