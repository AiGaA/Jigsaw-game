### Color Scheme <a name="color-scheme"></a>
The color scheme for thsi project was to choose a neutral colors, as the images would be bright and that would be the focus for the website. 
The color palette I chose to use was taken from [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/palette/f4f1de-e07a5f-3d405b-81b29a-f2cc8f) website.  
![alt text](./assets/docs/wireframes/color-scheme.PNG "Color palette that is used for website")

### Typography <a name="typography"></a>
For typography I chose to use downloadable [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=Montserrat).
These are three fonts that are used: Montserrat-Bold, Montserrat-Regular and Montserrat-Thin. If the browser does not support these fonts it should fall back to sans-serif.

### Images <a name="images"></a>
All images used in this project were custom made. All puzzle images were created using free design tool [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). This tool is very easy to use, and has good variety of free patterns, backgrounds and graphics.


## Testing <a name="testing"></a>

- The website was constantly tested during development using Chrome dev tools.
- All links and buttons were tested. Solved many, many puzzles to test, if all features work as should.
- Website was tested in Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.
- Lighthouse was used to test the website for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO for desktop and mobile:

### Bugs <a name="bugs"></a>

When implemented isSolved() function to the puzzle to show when puzzle has been solved in console.log it was going in infinte loop. 
The function call was misplaced and this was fixed by placing it into draw() function in js file, which have solved the issue. 
![alt text](./assets/docs/testing/Infinite-loop-bug.PNG "Showing infinite loop bug in console log")


When project was deployed bug below was coming up on accessing pages on the website, due to some file path declarations. This issue was resolved by fixing path to files and checked throughout the project making sure this does not happen. This issue was showing only on deployed pages. Made multiple repetative commits due to this issue. 
Clearing cache helped to resolve this.
